1. Revise Spring MVC flow diagram , with spring boot
Prepare request resp flow , for BEST clarity 
index.jsp(rendered by SC)  --> A link to Add Player  --> Add Player Form --> Process Form --> Validate n add Player details in the DB.
1.1 http://host:port/ctx_path/
--D.S -- H.M --HomeController.showHomePage --> /index --> index.jsp sent to clnt
1.2 After clnt click the link
Next req :http://host:port/ctx_path /teams/abbrs
(if cookies are disabled : appended bu JSESSIONID)
--> TeamController.getAllTeamsAbbreviations --> LVN --> 
add_player_form.jsp : sent to the clnt
1.3 After clnt submits form
Next req :http://host:port/ctx_path/players/add

One way of handling request params sent from clnt --> server
@RequestParam String abbr, 
			@RequestParam String fn, 
			@RequestParam String ln,
			@RequestParam @DateTimeFormat(pattern = "yyyy-MM-dd") LocalDate dob, @RequestParam double avg,
			@RequestParam int wickets

OR 
BUT if there are larger no of request params  : USE data binding technique
(view --> Model)
Refer : "day16_help\regarding form binding.txt"

2. Replace JPA based DAO layer by it's abstraction : Spring Data JPA

2. Ref docs : https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/2.7.14/reference/html/


3. Enter Spring boot REST
Understand RESTful web services n it's architecture , which sits on the top of Spring MVC
(Draw a comparison , with existing Spring MVC Flow Diagram)
